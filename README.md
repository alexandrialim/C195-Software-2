Description of the additional generated report:
For the 3rd report, I chose to display the number of customers per division. In this case, a division can also be referred to as state or provence. 
I wrote SQL queries to pull data from the First Level Divisions table and Customers table and move the output of that query into a new temporary table. 
The query that is used for generating this collection of data can be found in DAO.QueryReports.java
Once the data was created on the database end, I ran a SELECT * FROM command to get all the data in that table. 
As long as the user isn't running CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE manually in the database, there will not be any errors that occur in the database.
